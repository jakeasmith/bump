bump
====

A very naive script for bumping a semver tag in Git.

# Installation
If you have [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) setup already its as easy as installing Bump globally:
 
```composer global require bump/bump ^1```

Otherwise clone the repo, run `composer install` and it should be available in `./bin/bump`.

# Contributing
All PRs are welcome but you might want to open up an issue to discuss any major changes before putting a lot of time into them.
